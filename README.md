# ANALYSIS OF GRAND DATA

Author: Pablo Correa

Date: 19 June 2023

Required grandlib branch: dev_io_root


The scripts in this repository serve to analyse GRAND data in ROOT format. They make use of the grandlib package, 
but they are not included as a branch for grandlib at this time. The reason is that the scripts are for originally
created for personal use, but if desired, we could include them in a grandlib branch at a later time.

The analysis scripts are designed to be run on the IN2P3 computing center (CC) in Lyon. In addition, they are mostly
tethered towards the analysis of data collected in GP13 and Nan√ßay. In any case, each script contains a short
description of its functionality. 

Note that this code is neither optimal nor final - although they do work at least :)
